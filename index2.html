<h1>The Origins of Christmas</h1>
<h2>Aydans Sotelo</h2>
<p>"<strong>Christmas</strong>, celebrated annually on December 25, is a sacred religious holiday as well as a worldwide cultural and commercial <i>phenomenon</i>. For roughly two millennia, people around the world have been observing it with traditions and practices that are both religious and secular in nature. Christians celebrate Christmas Day as the anniversary of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, a spiritual leader whose teachings form the basis of their religion. Popular customs include exchanging gifts, decorating Christmas trees, attending church, sharing meals with family and friends and, of course, waiting for <i>Santa Clause</i> to arrive. Christmas Day—which falls on <i>Thursday, December 25, 2025</i>—has been a federal holiday in the United States since 1870."</p>

<p>"The end of <strong>December</strong> was a perfect time for celebration in most areas of Europe. At that time of year, most cattle were slaughtered so they would not have to be fed during the winter. For many, it was the only time of year when they had a supply of fresh meat. <strong>In addition</strong>, most wine and beer made during the year were finally fermented and ready for drinking."</p>
