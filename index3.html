<h1>My Winter Break</h1>
<h2>Favorite Foods</h2>
<p>Over my winter break I got to eat many different foods and got to experience many different tastes. During break one of the things I ate red tamales that were made by my aunt and tasted really good. I was lucky that we had leftovers so throughout my break I could eat tamales. I also got to <em>enjoy</em> some ice cream from my favorite ice cream place called Cold Stone. My usual order from Cold Stone is chocolate ice cream with oreos mixed in. It's my favorite and always tates good.</p>

<h2>What did I do?</h2>
<p>I spent a lot of my time over break at home just relaxing. I went to two Christmas parties though, and my mom was hosting one of them so I got to see a lot of family. I played a lot of video games over break. I also watched some football over break, but I was sad when the Bears lost one of their games. I started watching an anime called <em>Onepiece</em> again after I had stopped watching it a year ago. The last <em>exciting</em> things I did over break were going to the movie theater to watch two new movies. <em><strong>Avatar:Fire and Ash</strong> and Anaconda.</em> They were both really good movies, but my favorite one was Avatar, even though it was three hours it was worth it.</p>
